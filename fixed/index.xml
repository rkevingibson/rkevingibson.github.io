      <description>Below are a few projects that I have worked on in the past, including research and course projects.
Facial Recognition My final thesis project for undergrad. My group implemented a variety of facial recognition strategies, as well as a novel modification of the Eigenfaces approach. I built a system for scraping Facebook to generate a database based on photo tags, using openCV to extract the faces. Made for a fun demo, being able to recognize people in the audience.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto working in the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP), under the supervision of Karan Singh. I graduated from Queen&amp;rsquo;s University in 2014 with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Engineering, in the Computing and Communications option.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a variety of areas of computer graphics, particularly in the creation of more convincing digital humans. Outside of research I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in real time graphics and animation, as well as music.</description>
