      <description>I am a software engineer at Microsoft, working primarily on Spatial Mapping for Hololens. I got my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2016, and my graduated from the Mathematics and Engineering program at Queen&amp;rsquo;s University in 2014. Originally from Toronto, I now live in Seattle. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a variety of areas of computer graphics, including geometry processing, rendering, and physical simulation. Outside of research I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in music, good beer, and cooking.</description>
