      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a rendering backend to make creating quick-and-dirty OpenGL projects easier - basically a simple game engine that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable breaking apart and toying with. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m splitting off my OpenGL backend to run on a separate thread, so that while the engine is simulating frame N+1, the render thread is drawing frame N. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have a massive sync point between the two threads, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to surround everything in mutexes, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to have two copies of a lot of data: one that is owned by the render thread, and one that is owned by the game thread.</description>
