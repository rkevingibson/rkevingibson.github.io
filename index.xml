      <description>Recently I found a paper being presented at NeurIPS this year, entitled Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, written by Ricky Chen, Yulia Rubanova, Jesse Bettencourt, and David Duvenaud from the University of Toronto. The core idea is that certain types of neural networks are analogous to a discretized differential equation, so maybe using off-the-shelf differential equation solvers will help get better results. This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole of papers that I found very interesting, so I thought I would share a short summary/view-from-30,000 feet on this idea.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer at Microsoft working on Spatial Mapping for the Hololens. I got my Master&amp;rsquo;s of Computer Science at the University of Toronto working in the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP), under the supervision of Karan Singh. I graduated from Queen&amp;rsquo;s University in 2014 with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Applied Math.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a variety of areas of computer graphics, including surface reconstruction, physical simulation and rendering.</description>
