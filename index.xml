      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a rendering backend to make creating quick-and-dirty OpenGL projects easier - basically a simple game engine that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable breaking apart and toying with. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m splitting off my OpenGL backend to run on a separate thread, so that while the engine is simulating frame N+1, the render thread is drawing frame N. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have a massive sync point between the two threads, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to surround everything in mutexes, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to have two copies of a lot of data: one that is owned by the render thread, and one that is owned by the game thread.</description>

      <description>Below are a few projects that I have worked on in the past, including research and course projects.
Facial Recognition My final thesis project for undergrad. My group implemented a variety of facial recognition strategies, as well as a novel modification of the Eigenfaces approach. I built a system for scraping Facebook to generate a database based on photo tags, using openCV to extract the faces. Made for a fun demo, being able to recognize people in the audience.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto working in the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP), under the supervision of Karan Singh. I graduated from Queen&amp;rsquo;s University in 2014 with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Engineering, in the Computing and Communications option.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a variety of areas of computer graphics, particularly in the creation of more convincing digital humans. Outside of research I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in real time graphics and animation, as well as music.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m overdue to start writing, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to start adding some blog posts here. I don&amp;rsquo;t know that there will be a focus beyond &amp;ldquo;graphics programming,&amp;rdquo; but really I&amp;rsquo;ll post anything that I feel is interesting. They&amp;rsquo;ll likely be mainly technical articles, and for the first batch I&amp;rsquo;m planning a series of posts on implementing some physically based shaders, building on the content from the Siggraph courses on Physically Based Rendering.</description>
